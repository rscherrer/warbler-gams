# wrabler-gams

This repo contains a script used to help Claire Tsui with an analysis of senescence in Seychelles warblers involving Generalized Additive Models. The example workflow used here mostly follows Noam Ross's great [tutorial](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/). Note that this repository is mostly for bookkeeping purposes and comes without the data, which are not publicly available at the time of publishing this page.
